# Text-Summarization-Using-Transformers

Transformers is one of the most popular deep learning architecture that is used for natural language processing(NLP)

To overcome the issue of long-term dependencies of RNNs the new architecture transformers is introduced in the paper Attention-All-You-Need

Transformer use special type of attention mechanism called self attention mechanism

Here I used already available transformer pipeling for textsummarization

"TextSummarization.py" file used to create model used in "app.py" file will summarize our written text.

"app.py" file is a main file through which we can run our "FLASK_APP".
